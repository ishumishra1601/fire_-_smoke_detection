# fire_-_smoke_detection
Classification as Fire or Smoke

HereTensorflow Library is used.

Steps to perform this project:

1. Splitted the dataset into training and validation datasets.
2. Made a CNN of 3 layers using activation function as Relu.
3. Flattened the layers.
4. Added Dense Layer with activation function as Relu.
5. Added Output Layer with activation function as Sigmoid.
6. Trained the model with Adam Optimizer for 30 epochs.
7. Predicted the model on test data.
8. Achieved the result with 98% accuracy.
